# Valkey 8.0: Delivering Enhanced Performance and Reliability

The Valkey community is proud to unveil the first release candidate of Valkey 8.0,
Valkey 8.0 RC1, a major update designed to enhance performance, reliability,
and observability for all Valkey installations.

## Performance

Valkey 8.0 features significant improvements to the existing I/O threading system,
allowing the main thread and I/O threads to operate concurrently. This release also
includes a number of improvements to offload work to the I/O threads and introduces
efficient batching of commands. Altogether, Valkey 8.0 is designed to handle up to
1.2 million Queries Per Second (QPS) on AWS's r7g platform, compared to the previous
limit of 380K QPS. 

NOTE: Not all improvements are available in the release candidate, but they will
be available in the GA release of Valkey 8.0.


- **Asynchronous I/O Threading**: Enables parallel processing of commands and
  I/O operations, maximizing throughput and minimizing bottlenecks.
- **Intelligent Core Utilization**: Distributes I/O tasks across multiple
  cores based on realtime usage, reducing idle time and improving energy efficiency.
- **Command batching**: Optimizes memory access patterns by prefetching frequently
  accessed data to minimize CPU cache misses, reducing memory accesses required for
  dictionary operations.

## Reliability

Cluster scaling operations via slot migrations have historically been delicate.
Valkey 8.0 improves reliability and minimizes disruptions with the following
enhancements:

- **Automatic Failover for Empty Shards**: New shards that start empty, owning
  no slots, now benefit from automatic failover. This ensures high availability
  from the start of the scaling process.
- **Replication of Slot Migration States**: All `CLUSTER SETSLOT` commands are
  now replicated synchronously to replicas before execution on the primary. This
  reduces the chance of unavailability if the primary fails, as the replicas have
  the most up-to-date information about the state of the shard. New Replicas also
  automatically inherit the state from the primary without additional input from
  an operator.
- **Logical Link Recovery**: In the event of a failover, Valkey 8.0 automatically
  repairs the logical links between source and target nodes. This ensures requests
  are correctly routed to the new primary in the target shard, maintaining cluster
  integrity and availability.
- **Seamless Support for New Replicas**: New replicas joining a shard mid-migration
  will automatically inherit the correct slot migration state, ensuring immediate
  consistency.

## Replication

Valkey 8.0 introduces a dual-channel replication scheme, allowing the RDB and
the replica backlog to be transferred simultaneously, accelerating synchronization.

- **Reduced Memory Load**: By streaming replication data to the replica during
  the full sync, the primary node experiences significantly less memory pressure.
  The replica now manages the Client Output Buffer (COB) tracking, reducing the
  likelihood of COB overruns and enabling larger COB sizes on the replica side.
- **Reduced Parent Process Load**: A dedicated connection for RDB transfer frees
  the primary's parent process from handling this data, allowing it to focus on
  client queries and improving overall responsiveness.

Performance tests show improvements in write latency during sync, and in scenarios
with heavy read commands, the sync time can be cut by up to 50%. This translates
to a more responsive system, even during synchronization.

## Observability

Valkey 8.0 introduces a comprehensive per-slot metrics infrastructure, providing
detailed visibility into the performance and resource usage of individual slots.
This granular data helps inform decisions about resource allocation, load
balancing, and performance optimization.

- **CPU Usage**: Tracks CPU time consumed by operations on each slot, identifying
  areas of high utilization and potential bottlenecks.
- **Network Input/Output Bytes**: Monitors data transmission and reception by
  each slot, offering insights into network load and bandwidth utilization.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Initial benchmarks show that enabling detailed metrics
  incurs a negligible overhead of approximately 0.7% in QPS.

## Efficiency

Valkey 8.0 introduces key embedding in the main dictionary, eliminating separate
key pointers and significantly reducing memory overhead. This results in a 9-10%
reduction in overall memory usage for scenarios with 16-byte keys and 8 or 16-byte
values, along with slight performance improvements.

## Additional Highlights

- **Dual IPv4 and IPv6 Stack Support**: Seamlessly operate in mixed IP environments
  for enhanced compatibility and flexibility.
- **Improved Pub/Sub Efficiency**: Lightweight cluster messages streamline
  communication and reduce overhead for faster, more efficient Pub/Sub operations.
- **Valkey Over RDMA (Experimental)**: Unlock significant performance improvements
  with direct memory access between clients and Valkey servers, delivering up to
  275% increase in throughput.
- **Numerous Smaller Performance/Reliability Enhancements**: Many under-the-hood
  improvements ensure a smoother, more stable experience across the board.

## Conclusion

Valkey 8.0 is a significant update that offers improved performance, reliability,
and observability. Whether you are an experienced Valkey/Redis user or exploring
it for the first time, this release provides significant advancements in in-memory
data storage.
You can try out these enhancements today by downloading from [source](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/releases/tag/8.0.0-rc1) or using one of our [container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey).

**Important Note**: The Valkey Over RDMA feature is currently experimental and
might change or be removed in future versions.

We look forward to seeing what you achieve with Valkey 8.0!
